### EXP 002 - W! K=3 N=8 Rho=2/3
## One Walker, 3 pointn circle, 9 steps showing revival after 8 steps as per Dukes 2014
# Description
This experiment performs the probability distribution, purity and entropy calculations for rho=2/3 and everifies the results with experimental results from included python program.
In addition, the output plots probability distributions for each step and other interesting plots.

All calculations manually verified
